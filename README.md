# 🧑‍💼 TaskFlow (Task Management System)

A responsive and interactive task management dashboard built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It features role-based access (Admin + Employees), task status transitions, and persistent data using `localStorage`.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 Role-based Login

- **Admin** can view all employees and assign tasks.
- **Employees** can view only their tasks and update task status.

### ✅ Task States

Each task goes through one of the following states:

- 🆕 `New Task` → ⏳ `Active` → ✅ `Completed` / ❌ `Failed`

### 🧠 Local Persistence

- All employee data and tasks are saved in browser `localStorage`.
- Works offline; no backend required.
- Data persists across page reloads.

### 🧩 UI/UX

- Fully responsive
- Clear task categories and progress stats
- Modern React patterns (hooks + context API)
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean look
